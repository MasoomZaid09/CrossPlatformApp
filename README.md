📱 KMM Cross-Platform App
A scalable Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) app designed using MVVM architecture and Clean Architecture principles. It shares both logic and UI across Android and iOS using Jetpack Compose Multiplatform. Networking is handled by Ktor, and Koin is used for Dependency Injection.

🚀 Features
Shared business logic and UI for Android & iOS

Fetch remote data using Ktor

Shared UI using Jetpack Compose (Multiplatform)

MVVM + Clean Architecture

Dependency injection with Koin

Coroutine-based asynchronous operations

🧱 Tech Stack
Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

Jetpack Compose Multiplatform

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

Clean Architecture

Ktor for network requests

Koin for Dependency Injection

Coroutines for async operations

StateFlow / LiveData for UI state

Kotlinx Serialization for parsing

🧪 Testing
Unit tests for UseCases and ViewModels using Kotlin Test

Optional: Mocking with MockK

📦 API Used
Demo REST API endpoint (you can replace with real backend)

💡 How It Works
ViewModel calls the UseCase to fetch data

UseCase interacts with Repository (which uses Ktor client)

UI state is updated and rendered via shared Compose UI

Logic and UI are reused across Android and iOS

📌 Requirements
Android Studio Giraffe or later

Xcode 14+ (for iOS)

Kotlin 1.9+

Compose Multiplatform plugin

Cocoapods installed (for iOS builds)

Gradle 8+
